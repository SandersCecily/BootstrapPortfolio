                Hello! If you've come to read about me, then lucky for you, you're in the right place. 
                My name is Cecily Sanders and I am a student interested in development. I word it in this 
                ever specific manner because if I were to say web development I would be limiting myself as 
                I also take interest in software development and frankly if I have the opportunity to know 
                how something is made then I most definitely want to know. Currently I am attending the UPenn 
                Coding Bootcamp (shoutout to you guys, hey!) but, I am also a student at Temple University and 
                have my Associates from  Community College of Philadelphia. I major undergrad in Computer Science 
                and my Associates was actually in Information Technology and Sciences. I am a bit notorious for 
                wanting to be a jack of all trades and trying to be as useful as possible by being knowledgable about 
                a wide variety of subjects. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Personally I love working with people and computers! I thrive in a team collaborative enviroment but 
                also appreciate the ability to be able to brainstorm and bring my own personality to my work. Some of 
                those reasons are why I now work as a casino dealer but, also drive me away from the floor of the casino 
                to the home of an office space with (hopefully) a set group of diverse individuals getting ready to 
                work hard on any particular challenges that might arise.
